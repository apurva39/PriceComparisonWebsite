You can also <a href=\"http:\/\/rehubdocs.wpsoul.com\/docs\/rehub-theme\/how-to\/how-to-make-auto-contents-for-post\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">add sticky contents panel<\/a><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>While the GoPro Hero5 has many of the same specs as the previous generation when it comes to video and photo resolutions, there are some new features in it.\u00a0 Individually no single feature is a massive leap forward in the action cam industry, but collectively they represent a notable and substantial difference over the Hero4 Black.\u00a0 This section is mostly focused on these new features, while the remaining sections take a deeper dive into the core functions of the camera, as well as touch on these new features in more detail.<\/p>\n<p>Fully Waterproofed: Probably the most notable item is that the GoPro Hero5 Black is now fully waterproofed without the need for a separate case, just like the GoPro Hero4 Session was.\u00a0 In fact, it has nearly the same rubberish material on the outside.<\/p>\n<p>What is of more concern though is the USB-C\/HDMI port door.\u00a0 This door pops off for placement into the Karma gimbal\/drone, as well as just for charging:<\/p>\n<h2>Deals<\/h2>\n<div class=\"wpsm-titlebox clearbox wpsm_style_1\"><strong class=\"\">Gopro 5 deals<\/strong><div><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Now this won\u2019t easily pop-off while it\u2019s locked in place, as you have to press a button down to open it (plus slide it).\u00a0 But, the trick will be not losing it after charging your camera or while the charging cable is attached.\u00a0 GoPro does sell the door as an accessory (albeit over priced), and I know I plan to buy an extra door and then seal it up somewhere special in my backpack\/suitcase for traveling.\u00a0 Because I guarantee you that I\u2019ll lose it at the most inopportune time on a trip to some beautiful watery location and be unable to take pictures of The Girl underwater in a bikini without the door.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of doors that we don\u2019t want opening up, we\u2019ve also got the battery compartment down below.\u00a0 That holds both the battery as well as the micro-SD card:<\/p>\n<h2>Touch Display:<\/h2>\n<p>The Hero5 takes the touch display found on the Hero4 Silver and advanced it forward.\u00a0 As you might remember, the Hero4 Black actually lacked a display.\u00a0 This was one reason that the Hero4 Silver was actually a more day to day favorite of mine than the Hero4 Black was.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>However, the touch display acts and feels significantly different here than the Hero4 Silver.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The entire menu system has been redone to make it more intuitive to find settings.\u00a0 Along the bottom it shows you the basics for that mode.\u00a0 For example, in the video mode it shows you resolution and frame rate.<\/p>\n<p>You can tap on it to change these specs.\u00a0 Only the available frame rates will display for a given resolution.\u00a0 In theory this looks beautiful, but in practice it\u2019s actually more cumbersome than I expected.\u00a0 I think this is because there\u2019s just too many resolutions too closely together for a normal sized finger to hit the right resolution on that small display.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-182\" src=\"http:\/\/rewise.wpsoul.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/gopro3.jpg\" alt=\"gopro3\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On the right side of the display you can enable various advanced settings for that mode, such as ProTune, Image Stabilization, and Audio Control:<\/p>\n<p>From the top you\u2019ll be able to access general camera settings like WiFi connectivity and voice control. And from the left you can access the playback pages to review photos and videos you\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 I cover all this in-detail in this video below:<\/p>\n<hr class=\"wpsm-divider dotted_divider\" style=\"margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;\" \/>\n<span class=\"wpsm-highlight wpsm-highlight-yellow\">All of this is of course waterproof as well.\u00a0 Though, it won\u2019t work underwater.\u00a0 For that you\u2019ll need to use the push-buttons on the top\/side of the camera to change modes. <\/span>\n<hr class=\"wpsm-divider dotted_divider\" style=\"margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;\" \/>\n<p>Speaking of a wet display, in general I found it doesn\u2019t work well when wet either.\u00a0 Especially if your fingers are wet, it all goes to crap and fails to respond.<\/p>\n<p>As I said earlier, in theory the new GoPro Hero5 Black touch display layout looks good, but in practice it needs a bit more refinement.\u00a0 I found that the vast majority of the time while trying to change modes the slight display lag combined with tiny option selectors meant many missed attempts at configuring things.<\/p>\n<h2>Voice Control:<\/h2>\n<p>Like the VIRB Ultra 30, GoPro too introduced Voice Control this fall.\u00a0 This means you can simply tell your camera \u201cGoPro, Start Recording\u201d, and it\u2019ll indeed start recording.\u00a0 Same goes for photos, and even changing modes.\u00a0 In fact, you can actually swear an expletive that rhymes with \u2018hit\u2019 and it\u2019ll mark a highlight there.\u00a0 It\u2019s cool.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-180\" src=\"http:\/\/rewise.wpsoul.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/gopro1.jpg\" alt=\"gopro1\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can turn this option on\/off, and it\u2019s available in seven languages.\u00a0 Also, if you have the Remo accessory remote, that\u2019ll accept voice commands too in the event the camera is out of range of your voice.<\/p>\n<p>But\u2026it\u2019s not perfect.\u00a0 I found that it works most of the time when standing still.\u00a0 But once you start moving I found both it and the Hero5 Session actually perform worse than Garmin does.\u00a0 At about 10MPH (15KPH) I find the ability to give commands pretty much dies no matter which way the camera is facing.\u00a0 Whereas with Garmin it\u2019ll continue working above that speed as long as the camera is facing you.<\/p>\n<p>So you\u2019ll see that GoPro has more functionality (commands) than Garmin does.\u00a0 And earlier leaked manuals in August even showed GoPro being able to learn new commands you assign it (that hasn\u2019t happened yet\u2026but that\u2019d be super cool).\u00a0 But in usage, the Garmin actually works better when you start moving, and there\u2019s fewer failed commands.<\/p>\n<h2>GPS &amp; Sensors:<\/h2>\n<p>The Hero5 Black contains GPS.\u00a0 But that GPS won\u2019t do anything for you.\u00a0 See, the GPS on the Hero5 Black is merely used to geotag the location of your photos and videos.\u00a0 Essentially it does what Facebook and Instagram do with your phone by saying \u2018You were here\u2019 when you took this photo.\u00a0 It is NOT used to record your GPS tracks while you bike\/ski\/surf\/etc\u2026 Nor is it used to display your speed on videos.\u00a0 Basically, it\u2019s not used for much of anything except saying \u201cThis was taken in NYC\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This is obviously a huge disappointment for sports fans that wanted to overlay data like speed or distance onto their videos and have that all be done natively within the GoPro suite.\u00a0 After all, GoPro bought Dashware, the leading app for overlaying such metrics.\u00a0 Yet, tough beans for any usage there at this point.\u00a0 The GPS tagging icon is shown at the top left of the display:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-181\" src=\"http:\/\/rewise.wpsoul.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/gopro2.jpg\" alt=\"gopro2\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Electronic Image Stabilization, RAW Photos, Advanced Audio Tracks: I\u2019m bucketing all three of these together, not because they deserve to be together, but because I want to call them out here before I dive into them more deeply down below.\u00a0 These are in many ways some of the biggest differences between the Hero5 Black and Hero5 Session.\u00a0 While the Hero5 Session does have stabilization, it does not have the new RAW photo mode, nor does it have the Advanced Audio Track capability.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of which, let\u2019s talk audio and video modes.<\/p>\n<h2>Video &amp; Audio details<\/h2>\n<p>Ahh yes, video time.\u00a0 No better place to start diving into features than video modes.\u00a0 In many ways the Hero5 is similar in these modes to the Hero4 Black.\u00a0 After all, it too has 4K @ 30FPS and 720P @ 240FPS, the two ends of the spectrum that people often talk about.\u00a0 The footage looks beautiful in 4K \u2013 no doubt.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GoPro HERO5 IN-DEPTH! Hands-on!\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vvCuYUMzjyk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s new and notable here?\u00a0 Well we\u2019ll start with the video stabilization.\u00a0 Technically this is \u2018electronic image stabilization\u2019, which works by taking a larger resolution video clip (i.e. 4K) and then smoothing the video by offering a reduced resolution rate while stabilized (up to 2.7K).\u00a0 By doing this it essentially stabilizes by cutting the edges off the corners to make the video appear smooth.\u00a0 It\u2019s the same thing that Garmin does on their VIRB Ultra 30 (but the Garmin is limited to 1440 vs the higher 2.7K), but is different than what Sony does with their new X3000R, where they use optical image stabilization.\u00a0 That\u2019s better because it doesn\u2019t crop any of the image.<\/p>\n<hr class=\"wpsm-divider dotted_divider\" style=\"margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;\" \/>\n<span class=\"wpsm-highlight wpsm-highlight-blue\">To enable image stabilization, you\u2019ll simply swipe from the right.\u00a0 It\u2019ll warn you about cutting about 10% of the field of view:<\/span>\n<hr class=\"wpsm-divider dotted_divider\" style=\"margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;\" \/>\n<p>For cases where you\u2019ve got some light chop in the roadway, or even for hand holding the unit, image stabilization can dramatically improve things.\u00a0 Though, that\u2019s at the sacrifice of resolution.\u00a0 If your final output product\u2019s 1080p, then it\u2019s largely a no-brainer.\u00a0 Do note that it generally works better when you\u2019re shooting something that has a large portion of the image facing one direction constantly.\u00a0 Versus on a helmet mount, it can get a bit wonky as you move the view around a bunch.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s even more interesting though is the ability to record the native audio files from each microphone separately.\u00a0 If you enable ProTune, you\u2019ll see a new option to do this.\u00a0 Within that you have three levels:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-185\" src=\"http:\/\/rewise.wpsoul.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GoPro-Hero5-Black-Display_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"gopro-hero5-black-display_thumb\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some quick tests that I\u2019ve done with just straight recording times:<\/p>\n<p>1080p 30FPS (Wide): 2:07:41 (no WiFi\/GPS), 1:50:52 (WiFi\/GPS enabled)<\/p>\n<p>2.7K 30FPS (Wide): 1:45:05 (with WiFi Enabled)<\/p>\n<p>4K 30FPS (Wide): 1:31:10 (with WiFi enabled)<\/p>\n<p>All of these were simply taken at room temperature; obviously aspects like environmental temperature will impact things considerably, as will other modes and increased frame rates.\u00a0 But those give you some basic bounds to work within.<\/p>\n<h2>Photo mode:<\/h2>\n<p>While the Hero5 Black doesn\u2019t offer any more resolution than the Hero4 Black did, it does offer a number of substantial photo-focused features.\u00a0 First, the basics though.\u00a0 To get into the photo mode you\u2019ll go ahead and tap the mode button until you see photos.\u00a0 Or, just tell the GoPro to take a photo using voice commands.<\/p>\n<p>Now there are technically different photo modes, including the ability to take a burst photo, a series of photos as a timelapse, or night photos. Note that this photo timelapse is separate from the video timelapse option.\u00a0 This produces a crapton of photo files, whereas the video timelapse produces a single video timelapse file.<\/p>\n<p>Within the photo mode you can change resolution, as well as perspective.\u00a0 Resolution is set to 12MP.\u00a0 While perspective options are Wide, Linear, Medium, and Narrow.\u00a0 The linear one is the most notable new one, which aims to reduce the fisheye effect seen on many action cams.\u00a0 To understand these differences, here\u2019s a sample gallery of the different modes:<\/p>\n<p>The burst mode allows you to capture a moment of action with up to 30 frames per second.\u00a0 You can also configure it to have those frames spread out over a few seconds too:<\/p>\n<h2>HERO5 BLACK VS HERO5 SESSION:<\/h2>\n<p>So you\u2019re trying to choose between the Hero5 Black and the Hero5 Session.\u00a0 Both solid choices, and let me give you some food for thought on deciding between the two (the next section I talk about between the Hero5 Black vs the Garmin VIRB Ultra 30).\u00a0 Do note I\u2019m specifically talking here about the $299USD Hero5 Session, and *NOT* the cheaper $199 Hero Session, which lacks a ton of features compared to the $299 Hero5 Session.\u00a0 The key visible difference being the lack of the numeral \u20185\u2019 in the Hero Session name.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From a top-line standpoint, here\u2019s what the Hero5 Black has that the Hero5 Session lacks:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsm_checklist wpsm_pretty_list\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>12MP instead of 10MP pictures on Session<\/li>\n<li>GPS for location stamping<\/li>\n<li>Inability to swap out battery (it\u2019s not removable)<\/li>\n<li>RAW photo option<\/li>\n<li>WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) photo option<\/li>\n<li>Higher slow-mo specs (240fps on Black vs 120fps on Session)<\/li>\n<li>A handful less frame-rate options<\/li>\n<li>Touch display on the back (no display at all)<\/li>\n<li>Three mics vs two mics on Hero5 Session<\/li>\n<li>Ability to record individual audio streams<\/li>\n<li>HDMI port for direct viewing\/connection options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/div>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ll still get all this stuff on the Hero5 Session though:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsm_checklist wpsm_pretty_list\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2013 Voice control<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 Electronic Image Stabilization<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 WiFi Uploads to GoPro Plus<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 4K Video options<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 Karma Drone and Karma Grip Compatibility ($29 accessory required)<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 Waterproofing to 10m\/33ft<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 USB-C<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s the basic differences. Again, both cameras are very good, you won\u2019t go wrong with either.\u00a0 For me, I prefer the Hero5 Black because I like to be able to see and frame up what I\u2019m taking a photo\/video of.\u00a0 Whereas the Hero5 Session it\u2019s shoot and pray that you\u2019ve got it lined up.\u00a0 Sure, you can use your phone for certain shots \u2013 but most of us won\u2019t do that.<\/p>\n<h2>Latest news<\/h2>\n<div class=\"egg-wrap\">\r\n                    <div class=\"media border-grey-bottom pb10 mb20 flowhidden\">\r\n                            <div class=\"media-left pr20 pb10 celldisplay verttop\">\r\n                    <img style=\"max-width: 225px;\" class=\"media-object blockstyle thumbnail pt5 pl5 pr5 pb5 mb20 whitebg border-lightgrey\" src=\"http:\/\/rewise.wpsoul.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/gopro-hero6-review-the-best-action-camera.jpg\" alt=\"GoPro Hero6 Review: The Best Action Camera\" \/>\r\n                <\/div>\r\n                        <div class=\"media-body flowhidden celldisplay verttop\">\r\n                <h4 class=\"media-heading mt0 mb10\">\r\n                    <span class=\"ext-source\" data-dest=\"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/us\/gopro-hero-6,review-5068.html\">GoPro Hero6 Review: The Best Action Camera<\/span>                <\/h4>\r\n                <small class=\"text-meta font85 greycolor blockstyle mb10\">\r\n                    January 22, 2018 -\r\n                    <span class=\"ext-source\" data-dest=\"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/us\/gopro-hero-6,review-5068.html\">Tom's Guide<\/span>                <\/small>\r\n                <p>The Hero6 Black includes some internal upgrades that&#039;ll make it worth the higher price for professional photographers or videographers, but casual users might want to buy the previous-generation model....<\/p>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n        <\/div>\r\n                    <div class=\"media border-grey-bottom pb10 mb20 flowhidden\">\r\n                            <div class=\"media-left pr20 pb10 celldisplay verttop\">\r\n                    <img style=\"max-width: 225px;\" class=\"media-object blockstyle thumbnail pt5 pl5 pr5 pb5 mb20 whitebg border-lightgrey\" src=\"http:\/\/rewise.wpsoul.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/gopro-hero-6-black-review-the-waterproof-device-is-the-new-4k-video-pro.jpg\" alt=\"GoPro Hero 6 Black review: The waterproof device is the new 4k video pro\" \/>\r\n                <\/div>\r\n                        <div class=\"media-body flowhidden celldisplay verttop\">\r\n                <h4 class=\"media-heading mt0 mb10\">\r\n                    <span class=\"ext-source\" data-dest=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/magazines\/panache\/gopro-hero-6-black-review-the-waterproof-device-is-the-new-4k-video-pro\/articleshow\/62361026.cms\">GoPro Hero 6 Black review: The waterproof device is the new 4k video pro<\/span>                <\/h4>\r\n                <small class=\"text-meta font85 greycolor blockstyle mb10\">\r\n                    January 4, 2018 -\r\n                    <span class=\"ext-source\" data-dest=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/magazines\/panache\/gopro-hero-6-black-review-the-waterproof-device-is-the-new-4k-video-pro\/articleshow\/62361026.cms\">Economic Times<\/span>                <\/small>\r\n                <p>In terms of absolute specifications, features and performance, the Hero 6 Black is the device to beat as far as any action camera maker is concerned.
